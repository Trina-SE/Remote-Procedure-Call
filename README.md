# Remote-Procedure-Call
A small academic project.
# Description
Implement a simple client-server application using RPC.

The client sends a method invocation request to the server along with appropriate arguments. The server processes the request by executing the specified method on the provided arguments and sends the result back to the client.
For example, if the client invokes “factorial(4)”, the server should return “24”.
